# Watson-AMA
A response to reddit's call for a Watson AMA

I envision an interesting opportunity to market Bluemix and watson integration by responding to reddit's inquiry on a Watson AMA session.

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/30yjr6/ama_request_ibms_watson/ 

The structure looks like this:

1. A web ui to submit questions and receive answers

2. A watson ecosystem to feed past famous AMA's, IBm history and the future of AI

3. Confirmation that it is that simple.

There is an existing framework we can use to deploy this solution.

We do need approval from the IBM Watson team to spin up an instance.
Here is there first response.
"To help ensure the success of the program, we will be working with a limited number of business partners initially, but anticipate over time opening up broader access to the Ecosystem resources. As a next step we will review your submission based on concept potential, market feasibility, and technology alignment. We will reach out directly should we have any questions or require any additional information.

Thank you,
The IBM Watson Team"

This is likely dead after our buddy Victoria moved on from Reddit. Watson team has also not been very forthcoming with a corpus.
